The ultimate goal of this racing game, inspired by the classic KonamiÂ© "Road Fighter", is to travel the whole race distance without colliding into obstacle cars, or running out of time.
The player car controlled by the user can be moved left or right, and on the right of the screen are speed, time, and fuel displays.

Happy Racing! Please leave feedback, and I will work on it!
